title: Unlimited networks (I)
---

Suppose you have 100 nodes; each of them has its own x and y spatial coordinates. You are interested in learning how the structure of the network composed of the nodes and the edges forming between them affects the system dynamics.  Unfortunately, you have no clue whether there is an edge between any two nodes and, therefore, cannot conclude the configuration of the spatial network.  What should you do to generate testable/hypothetical networks in order to answer the interesting question you have in mind?

An intuitive solution is, based on the knowledge you have about the system, deciding whether there is an edge between two nodes.  Let's say, if the geometric distance between any two nodes is smaller than _d_ (kilometers), the two nodes are connected. Otherwise, they are not. 

In R, we can easily reproduce the nodes data in the above plot.

    set.seed(5)
    x = rnorm(100) * 100
    y = rnorm(100) * 100
    data = data.frame(x, y)
    
A distance matrix can help us generate an adjacency matrix in future steps.

    dist <- as.matrix(dist(data))

Let's set up _d = 20_.  That is, two nodes of which distance smaller than 20 km are connected.

    DM <- dist[] < 20
    diag(DM) = 0

In this way, we create an adjacency matrix. Isn't it easy?

We can write a function in R, which generates adjacency matrices based on the threshold distance _d_. 

    nt <- function(d) {
        DM <- dist[] < d
        diag(DM) = 0
        return(DM)
    }
    
With `lapply`, we can generate as many adjacency matrices as we want.

    thresholds <- seq(5, 10, 0.1)
    lapply(thresholds, nt)

This is a great first step. It can be the basis of generating more networks and computing network properties. We can go on to explore more. [Continue.](https://hhsieh.github.io/Unlimited_Networks-2/)
