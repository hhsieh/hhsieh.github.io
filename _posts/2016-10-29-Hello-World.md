title: Unlimited networks
---

Suppose you have 100 nodes; each of them has its own x and y spatial coordinates. You are interested in learning how the structure of the network composed of the nodes and the edges forming between them affects the system dynamics.  Unfortunately, you have no clue whether there is an edge between any two nodes and, therefore, cannot conclude the configuration of the spatial network.  What should you do to generate testable networks in order to answer the interesting question you have in mind?

This is a realistic question - it's a hurdle to jump over given the ecological data I have to deal with. And, in fact, the scale of the node number is much larger in space-time continuum!

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
