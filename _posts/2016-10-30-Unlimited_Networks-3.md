title: Unlimited networks (III)
---

Now it comes a bigger problem. Due to budget constraint, you only have sampled nodes within a rectangular plot.  Let's say the spatial coordinates of the four corners of the plot are, respectively, (-280, -220), (220, -220), (-280, 270), (220, 270). You only have data of the 100 nodes as in [Unlimited-Networks (I)](http://hhsieh.github.io/2016-10-29-Unlimited-Networks-1).

This constraint suggests that we do not have an entire network -- there would be more nodes outside the plot we were unable to sample. How to deal with this, then? One method is to hypothetically generate nodes outside the plot, perhaps based on the spatial pattern of the nodes inside the plot. Here, nevertheless, I am going to propose an alternative solution. We will simply use the information have in hand to approach the reality.
