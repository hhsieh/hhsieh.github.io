title: Unlimited networks (III)
---

Now it comes a bigger problem. Due to budget constraint, you only have sampled all of the nodes within a rectangular plot.  That comes up with the total 100 nodes you have as in [Unlimited-Networks (I)](https://hhsieh.github.io/Unlimited-Networks-1/).

This constraint suggests that we do not have an entire network -- there would be more nodes outside the plot of which data we are unable to obtain. This is unfortunate as an incomplete network would just affect concerned analyses. To solve this problem, one may think to hypothetically generate nodes outside the plot, perhaps based on the spatial pattern of the nodes inside the plot. Here, nevertheless, I am going to propose an alternative solution. We will simply use the information have in hand to approach the reality. 

Let's say the spatial coordinates of the four corners of the plot are, respectively, (-280, -220), (220, -220), (-280, 270), (220, 270).
