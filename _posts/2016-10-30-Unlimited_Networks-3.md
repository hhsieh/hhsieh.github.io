Now it comes a bigger problem. Due to budget constraint, you only have sampled nodes within a rectangular plot.  Let's say the spatial coordinates of the four corners of the plot are, respectively, (-280, -220), (220, -220), (-280, 270), (220, 270). You only have data of the 100 nodes as in [Unlimited-Networks (I)](http://hhsieh.github.io/2016-10-29-Unlimited-Networks-1).
