title: Unlimited networks (postscript)
---


For now, I am done with blogging the series of **Unlimited Networks**. The script in this series in fact comes from my Github repo [ulnet](https://github.com/hhsieh/ulnet), from which I am also developing a R package. This repo and the upcoming R package include more functions than there exists on the blog. Please refer to [ulnet](https://github.com/hhsieh/ulnet) if interested and come back for any new release in the near future. I also appreciate any comments on the blog posts as well as functions to include in the package.
