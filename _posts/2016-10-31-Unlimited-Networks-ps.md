title: Unlimited networks (IV)

For now, I am done with blogging the series of **Unlimited Networks**. The script in fact comes from my Github repo [ulnet](https://github.com/hhsieh/ulnet), from which I am developing a R package. This repo and the upcoming R package will include more functions. Please come back to check out any new release in the near future. I also appreciate any comments on the blog posts as well as functions to include in a package.
