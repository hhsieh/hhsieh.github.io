title: Unlimited networks
---

Suppose you have 100 nodes; each of them has its own x and y spatial coordinates. You are interested in learning how the structure of the network composed of the nodes and the edges forming between them affects the system dynamics.  Unfortunately, you have no clue whether there is an edge between any two nodes and, therefore, cannot conclude the configuration of the spatial network.  What should you do to generate testable networks in order to answer the interesting question you have in mind?

This is a realistic question - it's a hurdle to jump over given the ecological data I have to deal with. And, in fact, the scale in space-time continuum of my question is much greater than the example above!
