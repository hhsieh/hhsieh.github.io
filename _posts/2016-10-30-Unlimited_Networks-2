We can write a function in R, which generates networks based on the threshold distance _d_. 

    nt <- function(d) {
        DM <- dist[] < d
        diag(DM) = 0
        return(DM)
    }
    
With `lapply`, we can generate as many networks as we want.

    thresholds <- seq(5, 10, 0.1)
    lapply(thresholds, nt)
