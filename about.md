I am an ecologist and data scientist always excited about both domains, as integrating the two excites me the most! 

### More Information

I have a PhD in Ecology/Natural Resources and Environment and a data science certificate from the Data Incubator, a highly competitive bootcamp that only admits ~2% applicants! 

I love both academic science and applied industrial science. I also enjoy playing the piano and am an occassional writer. 

Over the past, I have been a translator, a research associate in the Industrial Technology Research Institute, Taiwan, and a freelance journalist of environmental issues. I reported the World Social Forum in Karachi, Pakistan, in 2006. I am always excited about learning new things and broadening my horizons.
