I am a Biodiversity Informatics Scientist. I hold a PhD in Ecology/Natural Resources and Environment and a data science certificate from the Data Incubator, a highly competitive bootcamp that only admits ~2% applicants. 

I love both academic science and applied industrial science. I also enjoy playing the piano and am an occassional writer. 

Over the past, I have been a translator, a research associate in the Industrial Technology Research Institute, Taiwan, and a freelance journalist of environmental issues. I reported the World Social Forum in Karachi, Pakistan, in 2006. I am always excited about learning new things and broadening my horizons.
